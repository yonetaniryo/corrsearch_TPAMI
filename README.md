# Correlation-based Person Search for First-Person Videos

This is a simpler version of the correlation-based person search proposed in our TPAMI paper:

Ryo Yonetani, Kris Kitani, Yoichi Sato: “Ego-Surfing: Person Localization in First-Person Videos Using Ego-Motion Signatures”, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI) [project page](https://yonetaniryo.github.io/2016/06/15/yks-cvpr2015.html)

Please refer to example.ipynb to see how it works.
